  ## Development vs. Production​

  During development, Vue provides a number of features to improve the development experience:

  - Warning for common errors and pitfalls
  - Props / events validation
  - Reactivity debugging hooks
  - Devtools integration
  
  
  However, these features become useless in production. Some of the warning checks can also incur a small amount of performance overhead. When deploying to production, you should drop all the unused, development-only code branches for smaller payload size and better performance.
  

  ## Without Build Tools​


  If you are using Vue without a build tool by loading it from a CDN or self-hosted script, make sure to use the production build (dist files that end in `.prod.js`) when deploying to production. Production builds are pre-minified with all development-only code branches removed.

  - If using global build (accessing via the `Vue` global): use `vue.global.prod.js`.
  - If using ESM build (accessing via native ESM imports): use `vue.esm-browser.prod.js`.
  Consult the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#which-dist-file-to-use"class="addcolortext"> dist file guide </a> for more details.

  ## With Build Tools​
  
  Projects scaffolded via create-vue (based on Vite) or Vue CLI (based on webpack) are pre-configured for production builds.

  If using a custom setup, make sure that:

  - `vue` resolves to `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js`.
  - The <a href="https://vuejs.org/api/compile-time-flags.html" class="addcolortext"> compile time feature flags </a> are properly configured.
  - `process.env.NODE_ENV` is replaced with `"production"` during build.

  ## Tracking Runtime Errors​

  The app-level error handler can be used to report errors to tracking services:
  
  ``` javascript
    // js
    import { createApp } from 'vue'

      const app = createApp(...)

      app.config.errorHandler = (err, instance, info) => {
          // report error to tracking services
       }
  ```

  Services such as <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/" class="addcolortext"> Sentry </a> and <a href="https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/javascript/vue/" class="addcolortext"> Bugsnag </a> also provide official integrations for Vue.
